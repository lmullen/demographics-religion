## Description of Directories

-   The `data` directory contains only historical data.
-   The `data-generated` contains data that has been modified or munged,
    for example, by geocoding place names.
-   The `functions` directory contains R code that has been abstracted
    from the individual analysis scripts.
-   The `outputs` directory contains the charts and maps produced by the
    analysis scripts.
-   The root directory contains R scripts that produce the outputs.
