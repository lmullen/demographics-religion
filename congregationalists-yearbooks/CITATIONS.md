Data in this directory is drawn from the Congregationalist yearbooks,
which are listed here:
<http://www.congregationallibrary.org/periodicals/yearbooks>

General Notes:

-   Some Congregationalist churches are listed in the records as
    "colored" or by some other racial marker. I have retained these
    terms in the names of the churches, but have used other terminology
    in the `race` column of the CSVs.

Notes for 1854 volume:

-   The totals in this volume are frequently incorrect, probably due to
    errors in arithmetic. These files contain transcriptions of the
    individual observations (for example, number of congregants in a
    church) but not the totals. The separate summary tables, however,
    have been transcribed.
