Data in this directory is drawn from the Congregationalist yearbooks,
which are listed here:
<http://www.congregationallibrary.org/periodicals/yearbooks>

Notes:

-   Some Congregationalist churches are listed in the records as
    "colored" or by some other racial marker. I have retained these
    terms in the names of the churches, but have used other terminology
    in the `race` column of the CSVs.
