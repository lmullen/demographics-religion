Data in this directory is from this source:

Weber, Herman C. *Presbyterian Statistics Through One Hundred Year, 
1826--1926: Tabulated, Visualized, and Interpreted*. Philadelphia: The 
General Council, Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., 1927. 
<http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007109885>.

Weber includes two sections, one of raw data compiled from the Minutes 
of the General Assembly, which apparently includes the foreign 
membership of the Presbyterian churches. The second section contains the 
data that Weber used for his visualizations, which excludes the foreign 
membership and makes various calculations on the data. 

Not all of the data in Weber is reproduced here.
